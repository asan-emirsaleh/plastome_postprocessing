## Warning!
This project is just a notebook to clean plastome data before submiting. This is not a final product. It is not suspected to be a final product or tool at some time. It was only created for development purpose.

The code is not an example of the good style. I prefer following imperative paradigma in notebook code, so it is neither optimized, DRY nor elegant. The code was just created to make things fast and to output the data of interest. I experiment with code styles out of the notebooks.
